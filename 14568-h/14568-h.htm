      PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In re-editing the present romance-poem I have been saved all labour of
      transcription by using the very accurate text contained in Sir F. Madden's
      "Syr Gawayne."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not only read his copy with the manuscript, but also the
      proof-sheets as they came to hand, hoping by this means to give the reader
      a text free from any errors of transcription.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present edition differs from that of the earlier one in having the
      contractions of the manuscript expanded and side-notes added to the text
      to enable the reader to follow with some degree of ease the author's
      pleasant narrative of Sir Gawayne's adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Glossary is taken from Sir F. Madden's "Syr Gawayne,"<sup>1</sup> to
      which, for the better interpretation of the text, I have made several
      additions, and have, moreover, glossed nearly all the words previously
      left unexplained.

      For a description of the Manuscript, and particulars relating to the
      authorship and dialect of the present work, the reader is referred to the

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No Knight of the Round Table has been so highly honoured by the old
      Romance-writers as Sir Gawayne, the son of Loth, and nephew to the
      renowned Arthur. They delighted to describe him as Gawayne the good, a man
      matchless on mould, the most gracious that under God lived, the hardiest
      of hand, the most fortunate in arms, and the most polite in hall, whose
      knowledge, knighthood, kindly works, doings, doughtiness, and deeds of
      arms were known in all lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Arthur beheld the dead body of his kinsman lying on the ground bathed
      in blood, he is said to have exclaimed, "O righteous God, this blood were
      worthy to be preserved and enshrined in gold!" Our author, too, loves to
      speak of his hero in similar terms of praise, calling him the knight
      faultless in his five wits, void of every offence, and adorned with every
      earthly virtue. He represents him as one whose trust was in the five
      wounds, and in whom the five virtues which distinguished the true knight
      were more firmly established than in any other on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of the present story, who, as we know from his religious poems,
      had an utter horror of moral impurity, could have chosen no better subject
      for a romance in which amusement and moral instruction were to be
      combined. In the following tale he shows how the true knight, though
      tempted sorely not once alone, but twice, nay thrice, breaks not his vow
      of chastity, but turns aside the tempter's shafts with the shield of
      purity and arm of faith, and so passes scatheless through the perilous
      defile of trial and opportunity seeming safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while our author has borrowed many of the details of his story from
      the "Roman de Perceval" by Chrestien de Troyes, he has made the narrative
      more attractive by the introduction of several original and highly
      interesting passages which throw light on the manners and amusements of
      our ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following elaborate descriptions are well deserving of especial
      notice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I. The mode of completely arming a knight (ll. 568-589).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        II. The hunting and breaking the deer (ll. 1126-1359).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        III. The hunting and unlacing the wild boar (ll. 1412-1614).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        IV. A fox hunt (ll. 1675-1921).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The following is an outline of the story of Gawayne's adventures, more or
      less in the words of the writer himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Arthur, the greatest of Britain's kings, holds the Christmas festival at
        Camelot, surrounded by the celebrated knights of the Round Table, noble
        lords, the most renowned under heaven, and ladies the loveliest that
        ever had life (ll. 37-57). This noble company celebrate the New Year by
        a religious service, by the bestowal of gifts, and the most joyous
        mirth. Lords and ladies take their seats at the table&mdash;Queen
        Guenever, the grey-eyed, gaily dressed, sits at the daïs, the high
        table, or table of state, where too sat Gawayne and Ywain together with
        other worthies of the Round Table (ll. 58-84, 107-115). Arthur, in mood
        as joyful as a child, his blood young and his brain wild, declares that
        he will not eat nor sit long at the table until some adventurous thing,
        some uncouth tale, some great marvel, or some encounter of arms has
        occurred to mark the return of the New Year (ll. 85-106).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The first course was announced with cracking of trumpets, with the noise
        of nakers and noble pipes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="i4">
          "Each two had dishes twelve,
        </p>
        <p class="i4">
          Good beer and bright wine both."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Scarcely was the first course served when another noise than that of
        music was heard. There rushes in at the hall-door a knight of gigantic
        stature&mdash;the greatest on earth&mdash;in measure high. He was
        clothed entirely in green, and rode upon a green foal (ll. 116-178).
        Fair wavy hair fell about the shoulders of the Green Knight, and a great
        beard like a bush hung upon his breast (ll. 179-202).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The knight carried no helmet, shield, or spear, but in one hand a holly
        bough, and in the other an axe "huge and unmeet," the edge of which was
        as keen as a sharp razor (ll. 203-220). Thus arrayed, the Green Knight
        enters the hall without saluting any one. The first word that he uttered
        was, "Where is the govenour of this gang? gladly would I see him and
        with himself speak reason." To the knights he cast his eye, looking for
        the most renowned. Much did the noble assembly marvel to see a man and a
        horse of such a hue, green as the grass. Even greener they seemed than
        green enamel on bright gold. Many marvels had they seen, but none such
        as this. They were afraid to answer, but sat stone-still in a dead
        silence, as if overpowered by sleep;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="i4">
          "Not all from fear, but some for courtesy" (ll. 221-249).
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Then Arthur before the high daïs salutes the Green Knight, bids him
        welcome, and entreats him to stay awhile at his Court. The knight says
        that his errand is not to abide in any dwelling, but to seek the most
        valiant of the heroes of the Round Table that he may put his courage to
        the proof, and thus satisfy himself as to the fame of Arthur's court. "I
        come," he says, "in peace, as ye may see by this branch that I bear
        here. Had I come with hostile intentions, I should not have left my
        hauberk, helmet, shield, sharp spear, and other weapons behind me. But
        because I desire no war, 'my weeds are softer.' If thou be so bold as
        all men say, thou wilt grant me the request I am about to make." "Sir
        courteous knight," replies Arthur, "if thou cravest battle only, here
        failest thou not to fight." "Nay," says the Green Knight, "I seek no
        fighting. Here about on this bench are only beardless children. Were I
        arrayed in arms on a high steed no man here would be a match for me (ll.
        250-282). But it is now Christmas time, and this is the New Year, and I
        see around me many brave ones;&mdash;if any be so bold in his blood that
        dare strike a stroke for another, I shall give him this rich axe to do
        with it whatever he pleases. I shall abide the first blow just as I sit,
        and will stand him a stroke, stiff on this floor, provided that I deal
        him another in return.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="i4">
          And yet give I him respite,
        </p>
        <p class="i4">
          A twelvemonth and a day;
        </p>

        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If he astounded them at first, much more so did he after this speech,
        and fear held them all silent. The knight, righting himself in his
        saddle, rolls fiercely his red eyes about, bends his bristly green
        brows, and strokes his beard awaiting a reply. But finding none that
        would carp with him, he exclaims, "What! is this Arthur's house, the
        fame of which has spread through so many realms? Forsooth, the renown of
        the Round Table is overturned by the word of one man's speech, for all
        tremble for dread without a blow being struck!" (ll. 283-313). With this
        he laughed so loud that Arthur blushed for very shame, and waxed as
        wroth as the wind. "I know no man," he says, "that is aghast at thy
        great words. Give me now thy axe and I will grant thee thy request!"
        Arthur seizes the axe, grasps the handle, and sternly brandishes it
        about, while the Green Knight, with a stern cheer and a dry countenance,
        stroking his beard and drawing down his coat, awaits the blow (ll.
        314-335). Sir Gawayne, the nephew of the king, beseeches his uncle to
        let him undertake the encounter; and, at the earnest entreaty of his
        nobles, Arthur consents "to give Gawayne the game" (ll. 336-365).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Sir Gawayne then takes possession of the axe, but, before the blow is
        dealt, the Green Knight asks the name of his opponent. "In good faith,"
        answers the good knight, "Gawayne I am called, that bids thee to this
        buffet, whatever may befall after, and at this time twelvemonth will
        take from thee another, with whatever weapon thou wilt, and with no
        wight else alive." "By Gog," quoth the Green Knight, "it pleases me well
        that I shall receive at thy fist that which I have sought here&mdash;moreover
        thou hast truly rehearsed the terms of the covenant,&mdash;but thou
        shalt first pledge me thy word that thou wilt seek me thyself,
        wheresoever on earth thou believest I may be found, and fetch thee such
        wages as thou dealest me to-day before this company of doughty ones."
        "Where should I seek thee?" replies Gawayne, "where is thy place? I know
        not thee, thy court, or thy name. I wot not where thou dwellest, but
        teach me thereto, tell me how thou art called, and I shall endeavour to
        find thee,&mdash;and that I swear thee for truth and by my sure troth."
        "That is enough in New Year," says the groom in green, "if I tell thee
        when I have received the tap. When thou hast smitten me, then smartly I
        will teach thee of my house, my home, and my own name, so that thou
        mayest follow my track and fulfil the covenant between us. If I spend no
        speech, then speedest thou the better, for then mayest thou remain in
        thy own land and seek no further; but cease thy talking<sup>1</sup> (ll.
        366-412). Take now thy grim tool to thee and let us see how thou
        knockest." "Gladly, sir, for sooth," quoth Gawayne, and his axe he
        brandishes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The Green Knight adjusts himself on the ground, bends slightly his head,
        lays his long lovely locks over his crown, and lays bare his neck for
        the blow. Gawayne then gripped the axe, and, raising it on high, let it
        fall quickly upon the knight's neck and severed the head from the body.
        The fair head fell from the neck to the earth, and many turned it aside
        with their feet as it rolled forth. The blood burst from the body, yet
        the knight never faltered nor fell; but boldly he started forth on stiff
        shanks and fiercely rushed forward, seized his head, and lifted it up
        quickly. Then he runs to his horse, the bridle he catches, steps into
        his stirrups and strides aloft. His head by the hair he holds in his
        hands, and sits as firmly in his saddle as if no mishap had ailed him,
        though headless he was (ll. 413-439). He turned his ugly trunk about&mdash;that
        ugly body that bled,&mdash;and holding the head in his hand, he directed
        the face toward the "dearest on the dais." The head lifted up its
        eyelids and looked abroad, and thus much spoke with its mouth as ye may
        now hear:
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Loke, Gawayne, thou be prompt to go as thou hast promised, and seek
        till thou find me according to thy promise made in the hearing of these
        knights. Get thee to the Green Chapel, I charge thee, to fetch such a
        dint as thou hast dealt, to be returned on New Year's morn. As the
        Knight of the Green Chapel I am known to many, wherefore if thou seekest
        thou canst not fail to find me. Therefore come, or recreant be called."
        With a fierce start the reins he turns, rushes out of the hall-door, his
        head in his hand, so that the fire of the flint flew from the hoofs of
        his foal. To what kingdom he belonged knew none there, nor knew they
        from whence he had come. What then?

        He looked upon Sir Gawayne and said, "Now, sir, hang up thine axe, for

        look upon it, and "by true title thereof tell the wonder." Then all the
        knights hastened to their seats at the table, so did the king and our
        good knight, and they were there served with all dainties, "with all
        manner of meat and minstrelsy."

        conversation. But a year passes full quickly and never returns,&mdash;the
        beginning is seldom like the end; wherefore this Christmas passed away
        and the year after, and each season in turn followed after another (ll.

        wearisome journey (ll. 521-535). On All-hallows day Arthur entertains
        right nobly the lords and ladies of his court in honour of his nephew,
        for whom all courteous knights and lovely ladies were in great grief.
        Nevertheless they spoke only of mirth, and, though joyless themselves,
        made many a joke to cheer the good Sir Gawayne (ll. 536-565). Early on
        the morrow Sir Gawayne, with great ceremony, is arrayed in his armour
        (ll. 566-589), and thus completely equipped for his adventure he first
        hears mass, and afterwards takes leave of Arthur, the knights of the
        Round Table, and the lords and ladies of the court, who kiss him and
        commend him to Christ. He bids them all good day, as he thought, for
        evermore (ll. 590-669);

        Now rides our knight through the realms of England with no companion but
        his foal, and no one to hold converse with save God alone. From Camelot,
        in Somersetshire, he proceeds through Gloucestershire and the adjoining
        counties into Montgomeryshire, and thence through North Wales to
        Holyhead, adjoining the Isle of Anglesea (ll. 670-700), from which he
        passes into the very narrow peninsula of Wirral, in Cheshire, where
        dwelt but few that loved God or man. Gawayne enquires after the Green
        Knight of the Green Chapel, but all the inhabitants declare that they

        however, was the sharp winter, "when the cold clear water shed from the
        clouds, and froze ere it might fall to the earth. Nearly slain with the

        morn he arrives at an immense forest, wondrously wild, surrounded by
        high hills on every side, where he found hoary oaks full huge, a hundred
        together. The hazel and the hawthorn intermingled were all overgrown
        with moss, and upon their boughs sat many sad birds that piteously piped
        for pain of the cold. Gawayne besought the Lord and Mary to guide him to
        some habitation where he might hear mass (ll. 730-762). Scarcely had he
        crossed himself thrice, when he perceived a dwelling in the wood set
        upon a hill. It was the loveliest castle he had ever beheld. It was
        pitched on a prairie, with a park all about it, enclosing many a tree
        for more than two miles. It shone as the sun through the bright oaks

        All this time Gawayne lies in his gay bed. His nap is disturbed by a
        little noise at the door, which is softly opened. He heaves up his head
        out of the clothes, and, peeping through the curtains, beholds a most
        lovely lady (the wife of his host). She came towards the bed, and the
        knight laid himself down quickly, pretending to be asleep. The lady
        stole to the bed, cast up the curtains, crept within, sat her softly on
        the bed-side, and waited some time till the knight should awake. After
        lurking awhile under the clothes considering what it all meant, Gawayne
        unlocked his eyelids, and put on a look of surprise, at the same time
        making the sign of the cross, as if afraid of some hidden danger (ll.
        1178-1207). "Good morrow, sir," said that fair lady, "ye are a careless
        sleeper to let one enter thus. I shall bind you in your bed, of that be
        ye sure." "Good morrow," quoth Gawayne, "I shall act according to your
        will with great pleasure, but permit me to rise that I may the more
        comfortably converse with you." "Nay, beau sir," said that sweet one,
        "ye shall not rise from your bed, for since I have caught my knight I
        shall hold talk with him. I ween well that ye are Sir Gawayne that all
        the world worships, whose honour and courtesy are so greatly praised.

        Gawayne behaves most discreetly, for the remembrance of his forthcoming

        in her arms and kissing him (ll. 1290-1307). The day passes away
        merrily, and at dusk the Lord of the castle returns from the chase. He
        presents the venison to Gawayne according to the previous covenant
        between them. Our knight gives his host a kiss as the only piece of good
        fortune that had fallen to him during the day. "It is good," says the
        other, "and would be much better if ye would tell me where ye won such
        bliss" (ll. 1308-1394). "That was not in our covenant," replies Gawayne,
        "so try me no more." After much laughing on both sides they proceed to
        supper, and afterwards, while the choice wine is being carried round,
        Gawayne and his host renew their agreement. Late at night they take
        leave of each other and hasten to their beds. "By the time that the cock
        had crowed and cackled thrice" the lord was up, and after "meat and
        mass" were over the hunters make for the woods, where they give chase to
        a wild boar who had grown old and mischievous (ll. 1395-1467).

        While the sportsmen are hunting this "wild swine" our lovely knight lies

        visit, seeking to make further trial of his virtues. She sits softly by
        his side and tells him that he has forgotten what she taught him the day
        before (ll. 1468-1486). "I taught you of kissing," says she; "that
        becomes every courteous knight." Gawayne says that he must not take that
        which is forbidden him. The lady replies that he is strong enough to
        enforce his own wishes. Our knight answers that every gift not given
        with a good will is worthless. His fair visitor then enquires how it is
        that he who is so skilled in the true sport of love and so renowned a
        knight, has never talked to her of love (ll. 1487-1524). "You ought,"
        she says, "to show and teach a young thing like me some tokens of
        true-love's crafts; I come hither and sit here alone to learn of you
        some game; do teach me of your wit while my lord is from home." Gawayne
        replies that he cannot undertake the task of expounding true-love and
        tales of arms to one who has far more wisdom than he possesses. Thus did
        our knight avoid all appearance of evil, though sorely pressed to do
        what was wrong (ll. 1525-1552). The lady, having bestowed two kisses

        the woods, and come upon the track of a fox, the hunting of which
        affords them plenty of employment and sport (ll. 1686-1730). Meanwhile
        our good knight sleeps soundly within his comely curtains. He is again
        visited by the lady of the castle. So gaily was she attired, and so
        "faultless of her features," that great joy warmed the heart of Sir
        Gawayne. With soft and pleasant smiles "they smite into mirth," and are
        soon engaged in conversation. Had not Mary thought of her knight, he
        would have been in great peril (ll. 1731-1769). So sorely does the fair
        one press him with her love, that he fears lest he should become a
        traitor to his host. The lady enquires whether he has a mistress to whom
        he has plighted his troth. The knight swears by St John that he neither
        has nor desires one. This answer causes the dame to sigh for sorrow, and
        telling him that she must depart, she asks for some gift, if it were
        only a glove, by which she might "think on the knight and lessen her
        grief" (ll. 1770-1800). Gawayne assures her that he has nothing worthy
        of her acceptance; that he is on an "uncouth errand," and therefore has
        "no men with no mails containing precious things," for which he is truly
        sorry.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Now, indeed," quoth Gawayne, "a desert is here; this oratory is ugly
        with herbs overgrown. It is a fitting place for the man in green to
        'deal here his devotions after the devil's manner.' Now I feel it is the
        fiend (the devil) in my five wits that has covenanted with me that he
        may destroy me. This is a chapel of misfortune&mdash;evil betide it! It
        is the most cursed kirk that ever I came in." With his helmet on his
        head, and spear in his hand, he roams up to the rock, and then he hears
        from that high hill beyond the brook a wondrous wild noise. Lo! it
        clattered in the cliff as if one upon a grindstone were grinding a
        scythe. It whirred like the water at a mill, and rushed and re-echoed,
        terrible to hear. "Though my life I forgo," says Gawayne, "no noise
        shall cause me to fear."
      </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Then he cried aloud, "Who dwells in this place, discourse with me to
        hold? For now is good Gawayne going right here if any brave wight will
        hie him hither, either now or never" (ll. 2189-2216).

        "Abide," quoth one on the bank above, over his head, "and thou shalt

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Soon there comes out of a hole in the crag, with a fell weapon a Danish
        axe quite new, the "man in the green," clothed as at first as his legs,
        locks and beard. But now he is on foot and walks on the earth. When he
        reaches the stream, he hops over and boldly strides about. He meets Sir
        Gawayne, who tells him that he is quite ready to fulfil his part of the
        compact. "Gawayne," quoth that 'green gome' (man), "may God preserve
        thee! Truly thou art welcome to my place, 'and thou hast timed thy
        travel' as a true man should. Thou knowest the covenants made between
        us, at this time twelve-month, that on New Year's day I should return
        thee thy blow. We are now in this valley by ourselves, and can do as we
        please (ll. 2217-2246). Have, therefore, thy helmet off thy head, and
        'have here thy pay.' Let us have no more talk than when thou didst
        strike off my head with a single blow."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Nay, by God!" quoth Gawayne, "I shall not begrudge thee thy will for
        any harm that may happen, but will stand still while thou strikest."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Then he stoops a little and shows his bare neck, unmoved by any fear.
        The Green Knight takes up his "grim tool," and with all his force raises
        it aloft, as if he meant utterly to destroy him. As the axe came gliding
        down Gawayne "shrank a little with the shoulders from the sharp iron."
        The other withheld his weapon, and then reproved the prince with many
        proud words. "Thou art not Gawayne that is so good esteemed, that never
        feared for no host by hill nor by vale, for now thou fleest for fear
        before thou feelest harm (ll. 2247-2272). Such cowardice of that knight
        did I never hear. I never flinched nor fled when thou didst aim at me in
        King Arthur's house. My head flew to my feet and yet I never fled,
        wherefore I deserve to be called the better man."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Quoth Gawayne, "I shunted once, but will do so no more, though my head
        fall on the stones. But hasten and bring me to the point; deal me my
        destiny, and do it out of hand, for I shall stand thee a stroke and
        start no more until thine axe has hit me&mdash;have here my troth."
        "Have at thee, then," said the other, and heaves the axe aloft, and
        looks as savagely as if he were mad. He aims at the other mightily, but
        withholds his hand ere it might hurt. Gawayne readily abides the blow
        without flinching with any member, and stood still as a stone or a tree
        fixed in rocky ground with a hundred roots.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Then merrily the other did speak, "Since now thou hast thy heart whole
        it behoves me to strike, so take care of thy neck." Gawayne answers with
        great wroth, "Thrash on, thou fierce man, thou threatenest too long; I
        believe thy own heart fails thee."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Forsooth," quoth the other, "since thou speakest so boldly, I will no
        longer delay" (ll. 2273-2304). Then, contracting "both lips and brow,"
        he made ready to strike, and let fall his axe on the bare neck of Sir
        Gawayne. "Though he hammered" fiercely, he only "severed the hide,"
        causing the blood to flow. When Gawayne saw his blood on the snow, he
        quickly seized his helmet and placed it on his head. Then he drew out
        his bright sword, and thus angrily spoke: "Cease, man, of thy blow, bid
        me no more. I have received a stroke in this place without opposition,
        but if thou givest me any more readily shall I requite thee, of that be
        thou sure. Our covenant stipulates one stroke, and therefore now cease."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The Green Knight, resting on his axe, looks on Sir Gawayne, as bold and
        fearless he there stood, and then with a loud voice thus addresses the
        knight: "Bold knight, be not so wroth, no man here has wronged thee (ll.
        2305-2339); I promised thee a stroke, and thou hast it, so hold thee
        well pleased. I could have dealt much worse with thee, and caused thee
        much sorrow. Two blows I aimed at thee, for twice thou kissedst my fair
        wife; but I struck thee not, because thou restoredst them to me
        according to agreement. At the third time thou failedst, and therefore I
        have given thee that tap. That woven girdle, given thee by my own wife,
        belongs to me. I know well thy kisses, thy conduct also, and the wooing
        of my wife, for I wrought it myself. I sent her to try thee, and truly
        methinks thou art the most faultless man that ever on foot went. Still,
        sir, thou wert wanting in good faith; but as it proceeded from no
        immorality, thou being only desirous of saving thy life, the less I
        blame thee."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Gawayne stood confounded, the blood rushed into his face, and he shrank
        within himself for very shame. "Cursed," he cried, "be cowardice and
        covetousness both; in you are villany and vice, that virtue destroy."
        Then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight in green,
        cursing his cowardice and covetousness. The Green Knight, laughing, thus
        spoke: "Thou hast confessed so clean, and acknowledged thy faults, that
        I hold thee as pure as thou hadst never forfeited since thou wast first
        born. I give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle as a token of thy
        adventure at the Green Chapel. Come now to my castle, and we shall enjoy
        together the festivities of the New Year" (ll. 2340-2406).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Nay, forsooth," quoth the knight, "but for your kindness may God
        requite you. Commend me to that courteous one your comely wife, who with
        her crafts has beguiled me. But it is no uncommon thing for a man to
        come to sorrow through women's wiles; for so was Adam beguiled with one,
        and Solomon with many. Samson was destroyed by Delilah, and David
        suffered much through Bathsheba. <i>'It were indeed great bliss for a
        man to love them well and believe them not.'</i> Since the greatest upon
        earth were so beguiled, methinks I should be excused. But God reward you
        for your girdle, which I will ever wear in remembrance of my fault, and
        when pride shall exalt me, a look to this love-lace shall lessen it (ll.
        2407-2438). But since ye are the lord of yonder land, from whom I have
        received so much honour, tell me truly your right name, and I shall ask
        no more questions."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Quoth the other, "I am called Bernlak de Hautdesert, through might of
        Morgain la Fay, who dwells in my house. Much has she learnt of Merlin,
        who knows all your knights at home. She brought me to your hall for to
        essay the prowess of the Round Table. She wrought this wonder to bereave
        you of your wits, hoping to have grieved Guenever and affrighted her to
        death by means of the man that spoke with his head in his hand before
        the high table. She is even thine aunt, Arthur's half sister; wherefore
        come to thine aunt, for all my household love thee."

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Gawayne refuses to accompany the Green Knight, and so, with many
        embraces and kind wishes, they separate&mdash;the one to his castle, the
        other to Arthur's court.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        After passing through many wild ways, our knight recovers from the wound
        in his neck, and at last comes safe and sound to the court of King
        Arthur. Great then was the joy of all; the king and queen kiss their
        brave knight, and make many enquiries about his journey. He tells them
        of his adventures, hiding nothing&mdash;"the chance of the chapel, the
        cheer of the knight, the love of the lady, and lastly of the lace."
        Groaning for grief and shame he shows them the cut in his neck, which he
        had received for his unfaithfulness (ll. 2439-2504). The king and his
        courtiers comfort the knight&mdash;they laugh loudly at his adventures,
        and unanimously agree that those lords and ladies that belonged to the
        Round Table, and each knight of the brotherhood should ever after wear a
        bright green belt for Gawayne's sake. And he upon whom it was conferred
        honoured it evermore after.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Thus in Arthur's time this adventure befell, whereof the "Brutus Books"
        bear witness (ll. 2505-2530).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I need not say that the <i>Brutus Books</i> we possess do not contain the
      legend here set forth, though it is not much more improbable than some of
      the statements contained in them. If the reader desires to know the
      relation in which this and the like stories stand to the original Arthur
      legends, he will find it discussed in Sir F. Madden's Preface to his
      edition of "Syr Gawayne," which also contains a sketch of the very
      different views taken of Sir Gawayne by the different Romance writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this and other <i>literary</i> questions I do not enter here, as I
      have nothing to add to Sir F. Madden's statements; but in the text of the
      Poem I have differed from him in some few readings, which will be found
      noticed in the Notes and Glossary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the manuscript is fast fading, I am glad that the existence of the
      Early English Text Society has enabled us to secure a wider diffusion of
      its contents before the original shall be no longer legible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want nothing but an increased supply of members to enable us to give to
      a large circle of readers many an equally interesting record of Early
      English minds.

          <i>Camalot</i>, in Malory's "Morte Arthure," is said to be the same as
          Winchester. Ritson supposes it to be <i>Caer-went</i>, in
          Monmouthshire, and afterwards confounded with <i>Caer-wynt</i>, or <i>Winchester</i>.
          But popular tradition here seems the best guide, which assigned the
          site of Camalot to the ruins of a castle on a hill, near the church of
          South Cadbury, in Somersetshire (Sir F. Madden).

          words<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in haste

          of <i>slaked hor lote3</i>, which, according to his glossary,
          signifies drunken vagabonds. He evidently takes <i>horlote3</i> to be
          another (and a very uncommon) form of <i>harlote3</i> = <i>harlots</i>.
          But <i>harlot</i>, or vagabond, would be a very inappropriate term to
          apply to the noble <i>Knights of the Round Table</i>. Moreover, <i>slaked</i>
          never, I think, means drunken. The general sense of the verb <i>slake</i>
          is to let loose, lessen, cease. Cf. lines 411-2, where <i>sloke</i>,
          another form of <i>slake</i>, occurs with a similar meaning:<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; <i>layt no fyrre; bot slokes</i>.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; seek no further, but stop (cease).<br />
          Sir F. Madden suggests <i>blows</i> as the explanation of <i>slokes</i>.
          It is, however, a <i>verb</i> in the imperative mood.

      PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

    <p>
      In re-editing the present romance-poem I have been saved all labour of
      transcription by using the very accurate text contained in Sir F. Madden's
      "Syr Gawayne."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not only read his copy with the manuscript, but also the
      proof-sheets as they came to hand, hoping by this means to give the reader
      a text free from any errors of transcription.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present edition differs from that of the earlier one in having the
      contractions of the manuscript expanded and side-notes added to the text
      to enable the reader to follow with some degree of ease the author's
      pleasant narrative of Sir Gawayne's adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Glossary is taken from Sir F. Madden's "Syr Gawayne,"<sup>1</sup> to
      which, for the better interpretation of the text, I have made several
      additions, and have, moreover, glossed nearly all the words previously
      left unexplained.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No Knight of the Round Table has been so highly honoured by the old
      Romance-writers as Sir Gawayne, the son of Loth, and nephew to the
      renowned Arthur. They delighted to describe him as Gawayne the good, a man
      matchless on mould, the most gracious that under God lived, the hardiest
      of hand, the most fortunate in arms, and the most polite in hall, whose
      knowledge, knighthood, kindly works, doings, doughtiness, and deeds of
      arms were known in all lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Arthur beheld the dead body of his kinsman lying on the ground bathed
      in blood, he is said to have exclaimed, "O righteous God, this blood were
      worthy to be preserved and enshrined in gold!" Our author, too, loves to
      speak of his hero in similar terms of praise, calling him the knight
      faultless in his five wits, void of every offence, and adorned with every
      earthly virtue. He represents him as one whose trust was in the five
      wounds, and in whom the five virtues which distinguished the true knight
      were more firmly established than in any other on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of the present story, who, as we know from his religious poems,
      had an utter horror of moral impurity, could have chosen no better subject
      for a romance in which amusement and moral instruction were to be
      combined. In the following tale he shows how the true knight, though
      tempted sorely not once alone, but twice, nay thrice, breaks not his vow
      of chastity, but turns aside the tempter's shafts with the shield of
      purity and arm of faith, and so passes scatheless through the perilous
      defile of trial and opportunity seeming safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while our author has borrowed many of the details of his story from
      the "Roman de Perceval" by Chrestien de Troyes, he has made the narrative
      more attractive by the introduction of several original and highly
      interesting passages which throw light on the manners and amusements of
      our ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following elaborate descriptions are well deserving of especial
      notice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I. The mode of completely arming a knight (ll. 568-589).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        II. The hunting and breaking the deer (ll. 1126-1359).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        III. The hunting and unlacing the wild boar (ll. 1412-1614).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        IV. A fox hunt (ll. 1675-1921).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The following is an outline of the story of Gawayne's adventures, more or
      less in the words of the writer himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Arthur, the greatest of Britain's kings, holds the Christmas festival at
        Camelot, surrounded by the celebrated knights of the Round Table, noble
        lords, the most renowned under heaven, and ladies the loveliest that
        ever had life (ll. 37-57). This noble company celebrate the New Year by
        a religious service, by the bestowal of gifts, and the most joyous
        mirth. Lords and ladies take their seats at the table&mdash;Queen
        Guenever, the grey-eyed, gaily dressed, sits at the daïs, the high
        table, or table of state, where too sat Gawayne and Ywain together with
        other worthies of the Round Table (ll. 58-84, 107-115). Arthur, in mood
        as joyful as a child, his blood young and his brain wild, declares that
        he will not eat nor sit long at the table until some adventurous thing,
        some uncouth tale, some great marvel, or some encounter of arms has
        occurred to mark the return of the New Year (ll. 85-106).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The first course was announced with cracking of trumpets, with the noise
        of nakers and noble pipes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="i4">
          "Each two had dishes twelve,
        </p>
        <p class="i4">
          Good beer and bright wine both."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Scarcely was the first course served when another noise than that of
        music was heard. There rushes in at the hall-door a knight of gigantic
        stature&mdash;the greatest on earth&mdash;in measure high. He was
        clothed entirely in green, and rode upon a green foal (ll. 116-178).
        Fair wavy hair fell about the shoulders of the Green Knight, and a great
        beard like a bush hung upon his breast (ll. 179-202).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The knight carried no helmet, shield, or spear, but in one hand a holly
        bough, and in the other an axe "huge and unmeet," the edge of which was
        as keen as a sharp razor (ll. 203-220). Thus arrayed, the Green Knight
        enters the hall without saluting any one. The first word that he uttered
        was, "Where is the govenour of this gang? gladly would I see him and
        with himself speak reason." To the knights he cast his eye, looking for
        the most renowned. Much did the noble assembly marvel to see a man and a
        horse of such a hue, green as the grass. Even greener they seemed than
        green enamel on bright gold. Many marvels had they seen, but none such
        as this. They were afraid to answer, but sat stone-still in a dead
        silence, as if overpowered by sleep;

          "Not all from fear, but some for courtesy" (ll. 221-249).
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Then Arthur before the high daïs salutes the Green Knight, bids him
        welcome, and entreats him to stay awhile at his Court. The knight says
        that his errand is not to abide in any dwelling, but to seek the most
        valiant of the heroes of the Round Table that he may put his courage to
        the proof, and thus satisfy himself as to the fame of Arthur's court. "I
        come," he says, "in peace, as ye may see by this branch that I bear
        here. Had I come with hostile intentions, I should not have left my
        hauberk, helmet, shield, sharp spear, and other weapons behind me. But
        because I desire no war, 'my weeds are softer.' If thou be so bold as
        all men say, thou wilt grant me the request I am about to make." "Sir
        courteous knight," replies Arthur, "if thou cravest battle only, here
        failest thou not to fight." "Nay," says the Green Knight, "I seek no
        fighting. Here about on this bench are only beardless children. Were I
        arrayed in arms on a high steed no man here would be a match for me (ll.
        250-282). But it is now Christmas time, and this is the New Year, and I
        see around me many brave ones;&mdash;if any be so bold in his blood that
        dare strike a stroke for another, I shall give him this rich axe to do
        with it whatever he pleases. I shall abide the first blow just as I sit,
        and will stand him a stroke, stiff on this floor, provided that I deal
        him another in return.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="i4">
          And yet give I him respite,

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If he astounded them at first, much more so did he after this speech,
        and fear held them all silent. The knight, righting himself in his
        saddle, rolls fiercely his red eyes about, bends his bristly green
        brows, and strokes his beard awaiting a reply. But finding none that
        would carp with him, he exclaims, "What! is this Arthur's house, the
        fame of which has spread through so many realms? Forsooth, the renown of
        the Round Table is overturned by the word of one man's speech, for all
        tremble for dread without a blow being struck!" (ll. 283-313). With this
        he laughed so loud that Arthur blushed for very shame, and waxed as
        wroth as the wind. "I know no man," he says, "that is aghast at thy
        great words. Give me now thy axe and I will grant thee thy request!"
        Arthur seizes the axe, grasps the handle, and sternly brandishes it
        about, while the Green Knight, with a stern cheer and a dry countenance,
        stroking his beard and drawing down his coat, awaits the blow (ll.
        314-335). Sir Gawayne, the nephew of the king, beseeches his uncle to
        let him undertake the encounter; and, at the earnest entreaty of his
        nobles, Arthur consents "to give Gawayne the game" (ll. 336-365).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Sir Gawayne then takes possession of the axe, but, before the blow is
        dealt, the Green Knight asks the name of his opponent. "In good faith,"
        answers the good knight, "Gawayne I am called, that bids thee to this
        buffet, whatever may befall after, and at this time twelvemonth will
        take from thee another, with whatever weapon thou wilt, and with no
        wight else alive." "By Gog," quoth the Green Knight, "it pleases me well
        that I shall receive at thy fist that which I have sought here&mdash;moreover
        thou hast truly rehearsed the terms of the covenant,&mdash;but thou
        shalt first pledge me thy word that thou wilt seek me thyself,
        wheresoever on earth thou believest I may be found, and fetch thee such
        wages as thou dealest me to-day before this company of doughty ones."
        "Where should I seek thee?" replies Gawayne, "where is thy place? I know
        not thee, thy court, or thy name. I wot not where thou dwellest, but
        teach me thereto, tell me how thou art called, and I shall endeavour to
        find thee,&mdash;and that I swear thee for truth and by my sure troth."
        "That is enough in New Year," says the groom in green, "if I tell thee
        when I have received the tap. When thou hast smitten me, then smartly I
        will teach thee of my house, my home, and my own name, so that thou
        mayest follow my track and fulfil the covenant between us. If I spend no
        speech, then speedest thou the better, for then mayest thou remain in
        thy own land and seek no further; but cease thy talking<sup>1</sup> (ll.
        366-412). Take now thy grim tool to thee and let us see how thou
        knockest." "Gladly, sir, for sooth," quoth Gawayne, and his axe he
        brandishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Green Knight adjusts himself on the ground, bends slightly his head,
        lays his long lovely locks over his crown, and lays bare his neck for
        the blow. Gawayne then gripped the axe, and, raising it on high, let it
        fall quickly upon the knight's neck and severed the head from the body.
        The fair head fell from the neck to the earth, and many turned it aside
        with their feet as it rolled forth. The blood burst from the body, yet
        the knight never faltered nor fell; but boldly he started forth on stiff
        shanks and fiercely rushed forward, seized his head, and lifted it up
        quickly. Then he runs to his horse, the bridle he catches, steps into
        his stirrups and strides aloft. His head by the hair he holds in his
        hands, and sits as firmly in his saddle as if no mishap had ailed him,
        though headless he was (ll. 413-439). He turned his ugly trunk about&mdash;that
        ugly body that bled,&mdash;and holding the head in his hand, he directed
        the face toward the "dearest on the dais." The head lifted up its
        eyelids and looked abroad, and thus much spoke with its mouth as ye may
        now hear:

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Loke, Gawayne, thou be prompt to go as thou hast promised, and seek

        knights. Get thee to the Green Chapel, I charge thee, to fetch such a
        dint as thou hast dealt, to be returned on New Year's morn. As the
        Knight of the Green Chapel I am known to many, wherefore if thou seekest
        thou canst not fail to find me. Therefore come, or recreant be called."
        With a fierce start the reins he turns, rushes out of the hall-door, his
        head in his hand, so that the fire of the flint flew from the hoofs of
        his foal. To what kingdom he belonged knew none there, nor knew they
        from whence he had come. What then?

        right nobly the lords and ladies of his court in honour of his nephew,
        for whom all courteous knights and lovely ladies were in great grief.
        Nevertheless they spoke only of mirth, and, though joyless themselves,
        made many a joke to cheer the good Sir Gawayne (ll. 536-565). Early on
        the morrow Sir Gawayne, with great ceremony, is arrayed in his armour

        Holyhead, adjoining the Isle of Anglesea (ll. 670-700), from which he

        high hills on every side, where he found hoary oaks full huge, a hundred
        together. The hazel and the hawthorn intermingled were all overgrown
        with moss, and upon their boughs sat many sad birds that piteously piped
        for pain of the cold. Gawayne besought the Lord and Mary to guide him to
        some habitation where he might hear mass (ll. 730-762). Scarcely had he
        crossed himself thrice, when he perceived a dwelling in the wood set
        upon a hill. It was the loveliest castle he had ever beheld. It was

        out of the clothes, and, peeping through the curtains, beholds a most
        lovely lady (the wife of his host). She came towards the bed, and the
        knight laid himself down quickly, pretending to be asleep. The lady
        stole to the bed, cast up the curtains, crept within, sat her softly on
        the bed-side, and waited some time till the knight should awake. After
        lurking awhile under the clothes considering what it all meant, Gawayne
        unlocked his eyelids, and put on a look of surprise, at the same time
        making the sign of the cross, as if afraid of some hidden danger (ll.
        1178-1207). "Good morrow, sir," said that fair lady, "ye are a careless
        sleeper to let one enter thus. I shall bind you in your bed, of that be
        ye sure." "Good morrow," quoth Gawayne, "I shall act according to your
        will with great pleasure, but permit me to rise that I may the more
        comfortably converse with you." "Nay, beau sir," said that sweet one,
        "ye shall not rise from your bed, for since I have caught my knight I
        shall hold talk with him. I ween well that ye are Sir Gawayne that all
        the world worships, whose honour and courtesy are so greatly praised.

        in her arms and kissing him (ll. 1290-1307). The day passes away
        merrily, and at dusk the Lord of the castle returns from the chase. He
        presents the venison to Gawayne according to the previous covenant
        between them. Our knight gives his host a kiss as the only piece of good
        fortune that had fallen to him during the day. "It is good," says the
        other, "and would be much better if ye would tell me where ye won such
        bliss" (ll. 1308-1394). "That was not in our covenant," replies Gawayne,
        "so try me no more." After much laughing on both sides they proceed to
        supper, and afterwards, while the choice wine is being carried round,
        Gawayne and his host renew their agreement. Late at night they take
        leave of each other and hasten to their beds. "By the time that the cock
        had crowed and cackled thrice" the lord was up, and after "meat and
        mass" were over the hunters make for the woods, where they give chase to

        his side and tells him that he has forgotten what she taught him the day
        before (ll. 1468-1486). "I taught you of kissing," says she; "that
        becomes every courteous knight." Gawayne says that he must not take that
        which is forbidden him. The lady replies that he is strong enough to
        enforce his own wishes. Our knight answers that every gift not given
        with a good will is worthless. His fair visitor then enquires how it is
        that he who is so skilled in the true sport of love and so renowned a
        knight, has never talked to her of love (ll. 1487-1524). "You ought,"
        she says, "to show and teach a young thing like me some tokens of
        true-love's crafts; I come hither and sit here alone to learn of you
        some game; do teach me of your wit while my lord is from home." Gawayne
        replies that he cannot undertake the task of expounding true-love and
        tales of arms to one who has far more wisdom than he possesses. Thus did
        our knight avoid all appearance of evil, though sorely pressed to do
        what was wrong (ll. 1525-1552). The lady, having bestowed two kisses

        the woods, and come upon the track of a fox, the hunting of which
        affords them plenty of employment and sport (ll. 1686-1730). Meanwhile
        our good knight sleeps soundly within his comely curtains. He is again
        visited by the lady of the castle. So gaily was she attired, and so
        "faultless of her features," that great joy warmed the heart of Sir
        Gawayne. With soft and pleasant smiles "they smite into mirth," and are
        soon engaged in conversation. Had not Mary thought of her knight, he
        would have been in great peril (ll. 1731-1769). So sorely does the fair
        one press him with her love, that he fears lest he should become a
        traitor to his host. The lady enquires whether he has a mistress to whom
        he has plighted his troth. The knight swears by St John that he neither
        has nor desires one. This answer causes the dame to sigh for sorrow, and
        telling him that she must depart, she asks for some gift, if it were
        only a glove, by which she might "think on the knight and lessen her
        grief" (ll. 1770-1800). Gawayne assures her that he has nothing worthy
        of her acceptance; that he is on an "uncouth errand," and therefore has
        "no men with no mails containing precious things," for which he is truly
        sorry.

        horse to the branch of a tree. He walks about the hill, debating with
        himself what it might be. It had a hole in the one end and on each side,
        and everywhere overgrown with grass, but whether it was only an old cave
        or a crevice of an old crag he could not tell (ll. 2149-2188).

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Now, indeed," quoth Gawayne, "a desert is here; this oratory is ugly
        with herbs overgrown. It is a fitting place for the man in green to
        'deal here his devotions after the devil's manner.' Now I feel it is the
        fiend (the devil) in my five wits that has covenanted with me that he
        may destroy me. This is a chapel of misfortune&mdash;evil betide it! It
        is the most cursed kirk that ever I came in." With his helmet on his
        head, and spear in his hand, he roams up to the rock, and then he hears
        from that high hill beyond the brook a wondrous wild noise. Lo! it
        clattered in the cliff as if one upon a grindstone were grinding a
        scythe. It whirred like the water at a mill, and rushed and re-echoed,
        terrible to hear. "Though my life I forgo," says Gawayne, "no noise
        shall cause me to fear."

        Then he cried aloud, "Who dwells in this place, discourse with me to
        hold? For now is good Gawayne going right here if any brave wight will
        hie him hither, either now or never" (ll. 2189-2216).

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Soon there comes out of a hole in the crag, with a fell weapon a Danish
        axe quite new, the "man in the green," clothed as at first as his legs,
        locks and beard. But now he is on foot and walks on the earth. When he
        reaches the stream, he hops over and boldly strides about. He meets Sir
        Gawayne, who tells him that he is quite ready to fulfil his part of the
        compact. "Gawayne," quoth that 'green gome' (man), "may God preserve
        thee! Truly thou art welcome to my place, 'and thou hast timed thy
        travel' as a true man should. Thou knowest the covenants made between
        us, at this time twelve-month, that on New Year's day I should return
        thee thy blow. We are now in this valley by ourselves, and can do as we
        please (ll. 2217-2246). Have, therefore, thy helmet off thy head, and
        'have here thy pay.' Let us have no more talk than when thou didst
        strike off my head with a single blow."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Nay, by God!" quoth Gawayne, "I shall not begrudge thee thy will for
        any harm that may happen, but will stand still while thou strikest."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Then he stoops a little and shows his bare neck, unmoved by any fear.
        The Green Knight takes up his "grim tool," and with all his force raises
        it aloft, as if he meant utterly to destroy him. As the axe came gliding
        down Gawayne "shrank a little with the shoulders from the sharp iron."
        The other withheld his weapon, and then reproved the prince with many
        proud words. "Thou art not Gawayne that is so good esteemed, that never
        feared for no host by hill nor by vale, for now thou fleest for fear
        before thou feelest harm (ll. 2247-2272). Such cowardice of that knight
        did I never hear. I never flinched nor fled when thou didst aim at me in
        King Arthur's house. My head flew to my feet and yet I never fled,
        wherefore I deserve to be called the better man."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Quoth Gawayne, "I shunted once, but will do so no more, though my head
        fall on the stones. But hasten and bring me to the point; deal me my
        destiny, and do it out of hand, for I shall stand thee a stroke and
        start no more until thine axe has hit me&mdash;have here my troth."
        "Have at thee, then," said the other, and heaves the axe aloft, and
        looks as savagely as if he were mad. He aims at the other mightily, but
        withholds his hand ere it might hurt. Gawayne readily abides the blow
        without flinching with any member, and stood still as a stone or a tree
        fixed in rocky ground with a hundred roots.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Then merrily the other did speak, "Since now thou hast thy heart whole
        it behoves me to strike, so take care of thy neck." Gawayne answers with
        great wroth, "Thrash on, thou fierce man, thou threatenest too long; I
        believe thy own heart fails thee."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Forsooth," quoth the other, "since thou speakest so boldly, I will no
        longer delay" (ll. 2273-2304). Then, contracting "both lips and brow,"
        he made ready to strike, and let fall his axe on the bare neck of Sir
        Gawayne. "Though he hammered" fiercely, he only "severed the hide,"
        causing the blood to flow. When Gawayne saw his blood on the snow, he
        quickly seized his helmet and placed it on his head. Then he drew out
        his bright sword, and thus angrily spoke: "Cease, man, of thy blow, bid
        me no more. I have received a stroke in this place without opposition,
        but if thou givest me any more readily shall I requite thee, of that be
        thou sure. Our covenant stipulates one stroke, and therefore now cease."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The Green Knight, resting on his axe, looks on Sir Gawayne, as bold and
        fearless he there stood, and then with a loud voice thus addresses the
        knight: "Bold knight, be not so wroth, no man here has wronged thee (ll.
        2305-2339); I promised thee a stroke, and thou hast it, so hold thee
        well pleased. I could have dealt much worse with thee, and caused thee
        much sorrow. Two blows I aimed at thee, for twice thou kissedst my fair
        wife; but I struck thee not, because thou restoredst them to me
        according to agreement. At the third time thou failedst, and therefore I
        have given thee that tap. That woven girdle, given thee by my own wife,
        belongs to me. I know well thy kisses, thy conduct also, and the wooing
        of my wife, for I wrought it myself. I sent her to try thee, and truly
        methinks thou art the most faultless man that ever on foot went. Still,
        sir, thou wert wanting in good faith; but as it proceeded from no
        immorality, thou being only desirous of saving thy life, the less I
        blame thee."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Gawayne stood confounded, the blood rushed into his face, and he shrank
        within himself for very shame. "Cursed," he cried, "be cowardice and
        covetousness both; in you are villany and vice, that virtue destroy."
        Then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight in green,
        cursing his cowardice and covetousness. The Green Knight, laughing, thus
        spoke: "Thou hast confessed so clean, and acknowledged thy faults, that
        I hold thee as pure as thou hadst never forfeited since thou wast first
        born. I give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle as a token of thy
        adventure at the Green Chapel. Come now to my castle, and we shall enjoy
        together the festivities of the New Year" (ll. 2340-2406).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Nay, forsooth," quoth the knight, "but for your kindness may God
        requite you. Commend me to that courteous one your comely wife, who with
        her crafts has beguiled me. But it is no uncommon thing for a man to
        come to sorrow through women's wiles; for so was Adam beguiled with one,
        and Solomon with many. Samson was destroyed by Delilah, and David
        suffered much through Bathsheba. <i>'It were indeed great bliss for a
        man to love them well and believe them not.'</i> Since the greatest upon
        earth were so beguiled, methinks I should be excused. But God reward you
        for your girdle, which I will ever wear in remembrance of my fault, and
        when pride shall exalt me, a look to this love-lace shall lessen it (ll.
        2407-2438). But since ye are the lord of yonder land, from whom I have
        received so much honour, tell me truly your right name, and I shall ask
        no more questions."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Quoth the other, "I am called Bernlak de Hautdesert, through might of
        Morgain la Fay, who dwells in my house. Much has she learnt of Merlin,
        who knows all your knights at home. She brought me to your hall for to
        essay the prowess of the Round Table. She wrought this wonder to bereave
        you of your wits, hoping to have grieved Guenever and affrighted her to
        death by means of the man that spoke with his head in his hand before
        the high table. She is even thine aunt, Arthur's half sister; wherefore
        come to thine aunt, for all my household love thee."

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Gawayne refuses to accompany the Green Knight, and so, with many
        embraces and kind wishes, they separate&mdash;the one to his castle, the
        other to Arthur's court.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        After passing through many wild ways, our knight recovers from the wound
        in his neck, and at last comes safe and sound to the court of King
        Arthur. Great then was the joy of all; the king and queen kiss their
        brave knight, and make many enquiries about his journey. He tells them
        of his adventures, hiding nothing&mdash;"the chance of the chapel, the
        cheer of the knight, the love of the lady, and lastly of the lace."
        Groaning for grief and shame he shows them the cut in his neck, which he
        had received for his unfaithfulness (ll. 2439-2504). The king and his
        courtiers comfort the knight&mdash;they laugh loudly at his adventures,
        and unanimously agree that those lords and ladies that belonged to the
        Round Table, and each knight of the brotherhood should ever after wear a
        bright green belt for Gawayne's sake. And he upon whom it was conferred
        honoured it evermore after.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Thus in Arthur's time this adventure befell, whereof the "Brutus Books"

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I need not say that the <i>Brutus Books</i> we possess do not contain the
      legend here set forth, though it is not much more improbable than some of
      the statements contained in them. If the reader desires to know the
      relation in which this and the like stories stand to the original Arthur
      legends, he will find it discussed in Sir F. Madden's Preface to his
      edition of "Syr Gawayne," which also contains a sketch of the very
      different views taken of Sir Gawayne by the different Romance writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this and other <i>literary</i> questions I do not enter here, as I
      have nothing to add to Sir F. Madden's statements; but in the text of the
      Poem I have differed from him in some few readings, which will be found
      noticed in the Notes and Glossary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the manuscript is fast fading, I am glad that the existence of the
      Early English Text Society has enabled us to secure a wider diffusion of
      its contents before the original shall be no longer legible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want nothing but an increased supply of members to enable us to give to
      a large circle of readers many an equally interesting record of Early
      English minds.

          But popular tradition here seems the best guide, which assigned the
          site of Camalot to the ruins of a castle on a hill, near the church of
          South Cadbury, in Somersetshire (Sir F. Madden).

          instead of <i>slaked hor lote&#541;</i>, which, according to his
          glossary, signifies drunken vagabonds. He evidently takes <i>horlote&#541;</i>
          to be another (and a very uncommon) form of <i>harlote&#541;</i> = <i>harlots</i>.
          But <i>harlot</i>, or vagabond, would be a very inappropriate term to
          apply to the noble <i>Knights of the Round Table</i>. Moreover, <i>slaked</i>
          never, I think, means drunken. The general sense of the verb <i>slake</i>
          is to let loose, lessen, cease. Cf. lines 411-2, where <i>sloke</i>,
          another form of <i>slake</i>, occurs with a similar meaning:<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; <i>layt no fyrre; bot slokes</i>.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; seek no further, but stop (cease).<br />
          Sir F. Madden suggests <i>blows</i> as the explanation of <i>slokes</i>.
          It is, however, a <i>verb</i> in the imperative mood.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
